This is the final project of Data and Visual Analytics, Gatech. Smart Meal Planner--a personalized recipe recommendation app was designed and built based on more than 30000 recipes downloaded from Yummly API.

I am responsible for the recommendation system app design, build, and nutrition intake analysis visualization with HTML5/CSS3/JavaSript/JQUERY/AJAX/PHP/D3.js.

This project got 100/100 of final grade.

83% users will use our app, and think that our recommendation functions are better than that provided by Yummly.
